# Hello world! I am Boseong Felipe Jeon üòÉ

ü§ñ I am a robotics engineer who loves building a
robotic system and exploring the latest advancements in the field of robotics.\
As a dedicated researcher and a developer with PhD, I have covered a wide range of
areas from designing hardwares, object recognition, online spatial mapping, and motion
planning & controls.

üé∂ Especially, I am an expert in **developing motion planning methods for UAVs** such as obstacle avoidance and dynamic target following.
